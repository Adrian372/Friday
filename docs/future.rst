Plugins
-------

* Input plugins which allow different front-ends to be used to communicate with the assistant.
* Loading plugins which allow the assistant to delay the user while the back-end is processing.
* Output plugins which allow the assistant to provide responses using different output systems like a GUI or text to speech.

Functionality
-------------

* Maybe allow different back-ends to be used (Eg. `wit.ai`)
* Fully functioning tests with example api.ai output
* More local functionality, allowing the system to do more without an internet connection
* Backup systems that work without internet
* Asynchronous behavior
