An open-source virtual assistant who got her name from an old project of one Tony Stark.
To be fair the name does bring up a few memories so that's pretty neat. Probably going to keep it just for that.
If you want to add something or point out how utterly horribly I've failed in my attempt of something... Please do.

Plans for this project:
 * Plugin system
 * Swap out core systems (Possibly hot-swappable)
 * GUI maybe
 * Add something awesome.
